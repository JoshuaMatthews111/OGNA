## 🚀 Building for TestFlight (Xcode Method)

### Prerequisites
1. **Xcode** installed (latest version)
2. **Apple Developer Account** (paid membership required for TestFlight)
3. **iOS Device or Simulator** for testing
4. **CocoaPods** installed: `sudo gem install cocoapods`

### Step 1: Pre-build the iOS Native Project

Since you want to use Xcode directly (not Expo's build service), you need to generate the native iOS project:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/user/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-5/OGNA

# Install dependencies if not already done
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Pre-build iOS native project
npx expo prebuild --platform ios

# This will create an 'ios' folder with the Xcode project
```

### Step 2: Install iOS Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to iOS folder
cd ios

# Install CocoaPods dependencies
pod install

# Go back to root
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Open in Xcode

```bash
# Open the workspace (NOT the .xcodeproj file)
open ios/overcomers-global-network.xcworkspace
```

### Step 4: Configure Xcode Project

1. **Select your Team**:
   - Click on the project in the left sidebar
   - Select the target "overcomers-global-network"
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Select your Apple Developer Team

2. **Update Bundle Identifier** (if needed):
   - Current: `com.overcomers.globalnetwork.app`
   - Change if you have a different one registered

3. **Set Deployment Target**:
   - Minimum: iOS 13.0 or higher
   - Recommended: iOS 14.0+

4. **Configure Capabilities**:
   - Camera Usage (already configured)
   - Photo Library Usage (already configured)
   - Background Modes > Audio (for music player)
   - Push Notifications (if needed)

### Step 5: Build for Simulator (Testing)

```bash
# Run on iOS Simulator
npx expo run:ios

# Or in Xcode:
# 1. Select a simulator from the device dropdown
# 2. Press Cmd+R to build and run
```

### Step 6: Build for TestFlight

#### Option A: Using Xcode Archive

1. **Select "Any iOS Device (arm64)"** from the device dropdown
2. **Product > Archive** (or Cmd+Shift+B)
3. Wait for the archive to complete
4. In the Organizer window:
   - Click "Distribute App"
   - Select "App Store Connect"
   - Select "Upload"
   - Follow the prompts
5. Go to App Store Connect to submit to TestFlight

#### Option B: Using EAS Build (Recommended)

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Build for iOS (production)
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Submit to TestFlight
eas submit --platform ios
```

### Step 7: TestFlight Submission

1. **Go to App Store Connect**: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. **Select your app**
3. **Go to TestFlight tab**
4. **Add build** (the one you just uploaded)
5. **Add testers**:
   - Internal testers (up to 100)
   - External testers (requires review)
6. **Submit for review** (if using external testers)

## 📱 Testing in Simulator

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# In another terminal, run iOS
npx expo run:ios

# Or specify a device
npx expo run:ios --device "iPhone 15 Pro"
```

- Check Info.plist has correct permission descriptions
- Reset simulator: Device > Erase All Content and Settings
- On real device: Settings > Privacy > Camera/Photos

### Issue: Metro bundler cache issues
**Solution**:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
# or
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

### Issue: CocoaPods installation fails
